Hi there!

I'm Wynn, a high school student graduating in Fall 2028. My MBTI is probably INFP-T, and I'm currently studying Advanced Placement courses.

I go by many internet identities—here are a few you're allowed to know 😈:

- **Wynn Zeng**: My English name—~**not yet** officially on my passport~. I chose it for the Welsh origin "Gwyn," meaning "pure white," rather than my family's original idea of naming me after a casino.
- **Crepvéant**: My nickname, derived from Latin (Crepusculum + Veniant). I originally wanted it as my English name but dropped it for being too chuuni.
- **Shirakawa Azusa (白川あずさ)**: My Japanese name, used for my [private GitHub account](https://github.com/AzusaBCSK) (and Apple Music). The corresponding ID is usually AzusaBCSK.

Please follow the UTC+8 normal human routine when contacting me—I do need my sleep!  

I have a soft spot for warm, fluffy, and cute things, which is why I believe that [<i>~~TECH OTAKUS SAVE THE WORLD!~~</i>](https://www.mihoyo.com/en) technology will make life even cozier. 🐾

**Fanatic (and slightly extreme) Apple fan**, currently using an iPhone 12 Pro and a MacBook Pro Early 2013.
My backup devices include iPhone Xs Max and Pixel 4XL. Really want a Surface Book 3 though.

Officially started high school and **LAZILY** ruining my GPA.
